                <h2>Captain John Price</h2>
                <p>The stalwart leader of Task Force 141, Captain Price is used to making difficult decisions. Some of those come back to haunt him when an old enemy resurfaces: The Russian ultranationalist, Vladimir Makarov. </p>

                <h2>Vladimir Makarov
                </h2>
                <p>Introduced at the end of MWII, the notorious leader of the Russian ultranationalist private military organization Konni Group, Makarov is as ambitious as he is meticulous and cruel. The only threat to his plans for global disorder and violence are Captain Price and Task Force 141, but with Makarov's sizeable head start, it may already be too late.</p>

                <h2>Simon "Ghost" Riley</h2>
                <p>There are the ghosts of the past, and then there’s Simon “Ghost” Riley. After General Shepherd and Shadow Company betrayed Task Force 141 during the events of Modern Warfare II, Ghost founded the aptly named “Ghost Company”, and killed international war criminal Hassan Ziyani. With this new threat on the horizon, Ghost is preparing for what may be Task Force 141's most difficult challenge yet.</p>
